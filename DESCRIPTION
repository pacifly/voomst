Description: Provides functionalities to estimate gene-wise count based negative
             binomial dispersions from log-cpm based mean-variance trend in limma::voom,
             and to derive variance stabilizing transformation similar as in DEXSeq.
             This enables derivation of dispersion estimates and variance stabilizing
             transformation from the popular limma-voom RNA-seq pipeline, without
             fitting negative binomial model that is slow and less flexible. The
             derived variance stabilizing transformation can be used to transform
             the RNA-seq read counts for downstream applications such as visualization
             and machine learning.
